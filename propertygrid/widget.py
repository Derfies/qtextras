    """
    Convenience wrapper to allow the property grid to set multiple objects'
    attributes at once. I'm still not 100% set on this being the solution as
    the code already looks a bit funky. But it works, and there's *kind* of an
    elegance to it.

    Part is this stems from the issue of loading objects into the property grid.
    By the default the grid searches for attributes using vars, which does not
    pick up computed python properties.

    A property will show if it's common to all objects.
    The property's value will be *visible* if it's the same for all objects.

    Note: Beginning to hate the "magickness" of the property grid, specifically
    how it picks up properties (ie via use of vars). It means that we can't have
    complex internals for a class like this without risking exposing them on the
    panel - the only reason 'objs' doesn't appear is because there is no property
    configured for it.
